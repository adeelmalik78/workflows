# ASSUMPTION - 
#   Developers are deploying changes to the Dev database
#   Developers commit SQL scripts and changelogs files to Git repo 
#   CI pipeline runs Liquibase Quality Checks and produces artifacts
#   CD pipeline deploys to Test and Prod databases

# pseudocode for Liquibase Flow file

liquibase validate
liquibase checks run
liquibase diff          # against snapshot after previous deployment to the same environment
liquibase update-sql    # output SQL prior to deployment


# No need to run snapshot here because 
#   ... developers have access to the Dev database and can make changes manually
#   ... developers use Dev database to work on future releases
# As such, there is no need to compare Dev with Test or Prod databases as there are changes in Dev database that are no eligible for Test and Prod

# Produce an artifact containing changelogs and SQL directories
#   ... Also include output from "diff" and "update-sql" commands.
