# ASSUMPTION - 
#   Developers are deploying changes to the Dev database
#   Developers commit SQL scripts and changelogs files to Git repo 
#   CI pipeline runs Liquibase Quality Checks and produces artifacts
#   CD pipeline deploys to Test and Prod databases

#   Snapshot from previous deployment to the same environment should be available for comparison.

# pseudocode for Liquibase Flow file

liquibase validate
liquibase checks run
# liquibase diff          # against snapshot after previous deployment to the same environment; moved to CI pipeline
liquibase status --verbose
liquibase tag           # tag database
# liquibase update-sql    # output SQL prior to deployment; moved to CI pipeline
liquibase update        # deploy new changes
liqubiase snapshot      # produce a new snapshot after new deployment and replace previous snapshot with this one
                        # Store snapshot in the constant location
liquibase history       # validate that new changes appear in this "history" output.
