# This workflow outlines on-demand rollbacks
# There are multiple rollback operations available in Liquibase
# ASSUMPTION -
#   Snapshot from previous deployment to the same environment should be available for comparison.

# Flow file as pseudocode

# Workflow 1: Rollback to tag
# Pipeline parameter: Tag_name

liquibase diff          # against snapshot after previous deployment to the same environment
liquibase rollback ${tag_name}  # rollback all new changes until the $tag_name} 
liqubiase snapshot      # produce a new snapshot after new deployment and replace previous snapshot with this one
liquibase history       # validate that rolled back changes no longer appear in this "history" output.



# Workflow 2: Rollback previous deployment
# Pipeline parameter: None

liquibase diff          # against snapshot after previous deployment to the same environment
liquibase rollback-one-update --force # rollback all changes that were deployed in the last deployment to this environment
liqubiase snapshot      # produce a new snapshot after new deployment and replace previous snapshot with this one
liquibase history       # validate that rolled back changes no longer appear in this "history" output.


# Workflow 3: Rollback specific number of changesets
# Pipeline parameter: Rollback_count

liquibase diff          # against snapshot after previous deployment to the same environment
liquibase rollback-count ${Rollback_count}      # rollback last X number of changesets, X = ${Rollback_count}
liqubiase snapshot      # produce a new snapshot after new deployment and replace previous snapshot with this one
liquibase history       # validate that rolled back changes no longer appear in this "history" output.
